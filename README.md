### Code Journal

- I installed the repo yesterday and fetched some stuff too today when i 
  itstalled i added wrong storyblok and it broke my work i did not understood 
  what was wrong so deleted whole repo and created new one still i had problem.
  All of sudden i remember that for nuxt3 i need diffrenet one
  so went back to my notes and opend the right document for storyblok and it worked
  [storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/mp/storyblok-meets-vue3-nuxt3).
